** TODO nv-alt style functionality
** TODO figure out how to get prettify-symbols to work inside comments
** TODO function to toggle flycheck buffer
** TODO plugin to programmatically pass text to minibuffer prompt and execute
** TODO zen mode -- superset of writeroom mode

disables linums
centers text on page

** TODO check out project-explorer
** TODO figure out how to change the color of glyphs in the display table (e.g. truncation)
** TODO show linums even if scrolled far to the right when there is truncation
** TODO an indent guide that doesn't choke all the time or eat linums
** TODO aggressive backspace that goes back to previous character in line or beginning of line
** TODO test runner framework per-language a-la jst-mode?
** TODO fix anyins so it doesn't lock up the scratch buffer

install anyins then open emacs without a target file --
it opens to scratch buffer in read only mode instead of the usual process.
not sure what's going on there.

** TODO call sort on region programmatically with <leader>s
** TODO vertically align code intelligently (better than regex)
** TODO show evil marks in gutter (see evil-visual-mark-mode)
** TODO get around recovery prompt with inotify?

Emacs auto saves backups to a dir, and if you open a file with an autosave it
asks you if you would like to recover the file, which is annoying. Worse, I
can't figure out how to disable that prompt.

Solution: run an inotify script as a service on boot that watches for emacs
backup files (#...#) in the dir emacs saves them to, then move them to a
different dir. Thus the autosavs are preserved, but emacs won't nag you every
time you open the file.

** TODO function to wrap selection at n characters (default 80)
** TODO paredit-style slurp function
