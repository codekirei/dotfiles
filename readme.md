Welcome `$HOME`!

These dotfiles are for a Unix OS (Linux, macOS), since that's where I choose to
do my development. This set up is untested (and unsupported) on Windows.

I'm using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) as my configuration tool of
choice.

My core workflow is centered around [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux). I enjoy working mostly in the terminal as
opposed to dedicated desktop GUIs (with a few notable exceptions, such as web
browsing).

## Stability: :yellow_circle:

I've been doing quite a bit of work on these lately, and I'm not done yet. I do
expect more changes in the near future.
